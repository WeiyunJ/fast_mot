- [x] Real-time object detection and tracking for highly constrained embedded systems (Jetson Nano)
  - Support all classes in the COCO dataset
  - Multiple objects can be acquired but only the closest target will be selected to track
- [ ] Drone flight control for following targets using both GPS and vision


### Dependencies
#### Visual tracking
- OpenCV (Built with Gstreamer)
- Numpy
- Scipy
- PyCuda
- TensorRT
#### Flight control
- DJI OSDK

### Run visual tracking only
- With camera: `python3 vision.py -a`
- Input video: `python3 vision.py -a -i video.mp4`
- Use `-h` for detailed descriptions about other flags like saving output and visualization
### Run the whole systems
- Coming out soon
